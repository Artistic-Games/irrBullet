{"name":"Irrbullet","tagline":"Bullet Physics wrapper for Irrlicht Engine","body":"[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Artistic-Games/DIrrlicht.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Artistic-Games/irrBullet)\r\n[![Stories in Ready](https://badge.waffle.io/Artistic-Games/irrBullet.png?label=ready&title=Ready)](https://waffle.io/Artistic-Games/irrBullet)\r\n\r\nirrBullet - Bullet Physics Wrapper for Irrlicht Engine\r\n======================================================\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n-------\r\n\r\nThis is a fork of irrBullet, which can be found at https://irrbullet.svn.sourceforge.net/\r\n\r\nIt is an updated version of irrBullet which works with Irrlicht 1.8.1 and latest SVN branch (unstable) and Bullet 2.82. It also has several improvements over outdated irrBullet. I tried contacting the original author of irrBullet, but got no response.\r\n\r\nNote: The following version hasn't released yet and maybe unstable. If you find any bug, then please open an issue in issues tracker. Thanks.\r\n\r\nWhat's new in 0.1.9\r\n-------------------\r\n* Performance improvement (refactored loops, replaced Irrlicht's containers with STL, add move semantics etc)\r\n* Several bug fixes\r\n* Support for latest versions of Bullet and Irrlicht\r\n* ICapsuleShape and ICylinderShape added\r\n* IRigidBody, irrBulletWorld etc are feature complete (all methods have been wrapped)\r\n* Strong C++11 support - dropped support for non-C++11 compilers\r\n* irrBullet is forked - now maintained by Danyal Zia\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nOn windows open Dependencies_Path.bat in directory and change respective environment variables to Bullet and Irrlicht's root directory and run it, then in \"source/\" open the project file of your favorite IDE (Visual Studio and Code::Blocks is currently supported) and compile. You will then find the compiled library in \"lib/your_platform\".\r\n\r\nTo compile examples go to \"examples/\" and open the project and compile, you'll then find the compiled binaries in \"bin/your_platform\". Please note that if you have compiled using shared Irrlicht binary then you need to copy Irrlicht.dll/.so from Irrlicht's directory to \"bin/your_platform\" in order to run the examples.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nIt is released under permissive zlib license same as Bullet and Irrlicht.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
