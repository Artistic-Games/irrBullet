This is a fork of irrBullet, which can be found at https://irrbullet.svn.sourceforge.net/

It is an updated version of irrBullet which works with Irrlicht 1.8.1 and latest SVN (unstable) and Bullet 2.82. It also has several improvements over outdated irrBullet. I tried contacting the original author of irrBullet, but got no response.
